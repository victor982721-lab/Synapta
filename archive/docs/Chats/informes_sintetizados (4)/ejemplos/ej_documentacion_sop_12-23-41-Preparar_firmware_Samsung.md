### Entrada (user)

{"content_type": "user_editable_context", "user_profile": "Very important: The user's timezone is America/Mexico_City. The current date is 17th September, 2025. Any dates before this are in the past, and any dates after this are in the future. When dealing with modern entities/companies/people, and the user asks for the 'latest', 'most recent', 'today's', etc. don't assume your knowledge is up to date; you MUST carefully confirm what the *true* 'latest' is first. If the user seems confused or mistaken about a certain date or dates, you MUST include specific, concrete dates in your response to clarify things. This is especially important when the user is referencing relative dates like 'today', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', etc -- if the user seems mistaken in these cases, you should make sure to use absolute/exact dates like 'January 1, 2010' in your response.\nThe user's location is Mexico City, Mexico City, Mexico.\n\n", "user_instructions": "If I ask about events that occur after the knowledge cutoff or about a current/ongoing topic, do not rely on your stored knowledge. Instead, use the search tool first to find recent or current information. Return and cite relevant results from that search before answering the question. If youâ€™re unable to find recent data after searching, state that clearly.\n DO NOT PUT LONG SENTENCES IN MARKDOWN TABLES. Tables are for keywords, phrases, numbers, and images. Keep prose in the body."}
